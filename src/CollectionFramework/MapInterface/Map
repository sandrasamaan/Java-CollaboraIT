Map Interface:
1. Key and value pair ...
k = key
v = value
Map<k,v> nameMap = new HashMap<>();

list of class that implemented Map interface
1. Hashtable : Very similar to HashMap except it is ThreadSafe( It also doesn't allow null value as a key).
2. LinkedHashMap : provide data in insertion order
3. HashMap : makes no guarantee of iteration order(Faster but not thread safe)
4. TreeMap : provide data in Ascending order Capital A-Z then small a-z (However it is much slower than HashMap)


1. Create POJO class person
    person - ID(Long), Name, Date(Date class), Address

2. Ceate with HashMap and user person class as value ..
    1. Add the data by calling constructor of person class
    2. Remove
    3. Clone
    4. ContainKey
    5. Loop Using key/value pair
